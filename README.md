# Diploma Thesis
## by Stefan Selig & Valentin HengstschlÃ¤ger

**Note: Everything here is parted into server and client, because each part is graded individually.** 

## Installation & Deployment:

### For Client:

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/stefanselig/BeefinderDiplomaThesis.git>
> cd beekeeper-client
> npm install
```
### For Server:

```shell
> git clone https://github.com/stefanselig/BeefinderDiplomaThesis.git>
> cd beekeeper-server
> npm install
```


## Issues/Problems and new Insights:

### 16.12.15 - Client

Angular version 2 beta 1 was released today. Updated files to meet setup recommendation of Angular 2 team.
There are some errors when compiling the typescript files. The typescript transpiler somehow can't find the Angular modules.

```shell
> tsc -p app -w

app/boot.ts(2,25): error TS2307: Cannot find module 'angular2/platform/browser'.
app/boot.ts(3,32): error TS2307: Cannot find module 'angular2/router'.
app/login/login.component.ts(1,25): error TS2307: Cannot find module 'angular2/core'.
app/main/app.component.ts(1,25): error TS2307: Cannot find module 'angular2/core'.
app/main/app.component.ts(2,46): error TS2307: Cannot find module 'angular2/router'.
app/signup/signup.component.ts(1,25): error TS2307: Cannot find module 'angular2/core'.
```

But even with the errors, the program works fine. So the typescript transpile can't find those files even though they are existent.

### 20.12.15 - Server
Points issue - still to add

### 27.12.15 - Server
DocumentDB issue - still to add

## 31.12.15 - Client

Angular 2 can't handle input type="date" yet. Model date value is not displayed in the view.

## xx.01.16 - Client

Some errors with modules.

## 11.01.16 - Client

Somehow in a form angular2 recognizes every button click as a submit, even if another function call was intended.

## 13.01.16 - Server

Problem with mongoose schema/model.(not possible to map object) - still to add

##14.01.16 - Server

Everything rewritten to Typescript - still to add

## Other Documentation:

### Skripts: 

#### Client: 

```shell
> npm run tsc
```

will execute the typescript compiler:

```shell
> tsc -p app -w
```

This command compiles the \*.ts files and creates matching \*.js and \*.map.js files.
It will do that in the app folder, because there are our script files located.
The -w parameter specifies that the compiler is constantly watching our typescript files and transpiles them as soon as they are changed.

```shell
> npm run start
```

will execute a server that serves our static files:

```shell
> lite-server --verbose
```

The --verbose parameter specifies that additional information is logged when executing.
Again this tool live-reloads when changes in code are detected.

```shell
> npm run start
```

will execute a server that serves our static files:

```shell
> live-server
```

Again this tool live-reloads when changes in code are detected.
The reason why we have scripts for two servers included in our project is that the Angular 2 team formerly 
recommended live-server, but since beta 1 they recommend lite-server. We have not yet decided which one to use.

#### Server:

### Background about the used technologies:

#### Client

** TODO: Add used technologies and description. **

typescript (incl. ts-config), angular2, systemjs, es6-promise, es6-shim, reflect-metadata, rxjs, zone.js, live-server, lite-server, gulp, angular2-router, angular2-polyfills


#### Server

### Modules in JS:

There are many different JS module formats available, including:

- amd
- umd
- commonjs
- system

The used system must be specified in the typescript tsconfig.json file.
The one we use on the server is commonjs and the one we use on the client is systemjs.
For system modules to work there has to be the SystemJS library installed.

There's a different syntax needed for importing modules as followed:

##### es6 import syntax:

```javascript
import {abc} from './src/routes/Bhives';
```

Typescript is a powerful programming language, 
that allows us to use es6 features that also get compiled to old .js.

##### ts import syntax:
(Write "export" in front of everything you want to make 
available to the outside. (That's basically like defining an object "public"):

```javascript
import xyz = require('./src/routes/Bhives');
```

##### node import syntax:

```javascript
var uvw = require('./src/routes/Bhives');
```

##### ts reference for internal modules (Don't "export" your code if you want to use that!):

```javascript
/// <reference path='./src/routes/Bhives.ts' />
```

##### How to use the imported modules:

```javascript
// If ts reference or es6 import is used:
var a = new abc();

// if ts import or node import is used:
var b = new xyz.abc();
```
